In development.

Requirements:
- Python
- Pip
- Pygame

The game will not work until you change each instance of a file being mentioned. 

Here is some example code. Simple use the control + find tool on you IDE and replace all instances of " orc_blaster_files"
with whatever folder you have the files in. All files used in the game are found in the Images folder on this repo

play_font = pygame.font.Font('orc_blaster_files/Audiowide-Regular.ttf',30)

This really should be the only requirements, the only reasons I can think of that it wouldn't work would be having the necessary 
installations, and make sure the files are being pulled from the right folder.
